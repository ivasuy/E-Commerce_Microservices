### Microservice Requirements:

1.**Customer Microservice**: - Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing customer information. - Allow customers to register, update their profile, and view their information.
2.**Vendor Microservice**: - Implemented CRUD operations for managing vendor details. - Allow vendors to register, update their profile, and view their information.
3.**Order Microservice**: - Implemented operations to create new orders, retrieve order details, and update order status.
4.**Item Microservice**: - Implemented operations to manage items available for sale. - Allow vendors to add/update/delete their products.

### API End Points :

To Access Eureka Server Use Link : http://localhost:8761/

 

To Access Secure End Points :

1. Go to Okta Auth Link â†’ http://localhost:9090/authenticate/login
2. Enter Username: *201514@juitsolan.in*
3. Enter Password: Vasu123@
4. Now Use `"accessToken"` to access secure end points

### How To Run Application :

- Open The Project on your compiler.
- Configure application.yml files of the services:
    - ItemService
    - VendorService
    - CustomerService
    - OrderService
- Build the application.
- First run service-registry service it is eureka server.
- Then run ConfigServer service it has common configurations for services, To run this make sure you are connected to internet.
- Now you can run  CloudGateway service it is API gateway for internal services. It runs on `http://localhost:9090`
- You are ready to run internal services.
